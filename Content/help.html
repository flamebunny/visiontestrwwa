<h3 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions &mdash; General</h3>
<h4>What mobile devices can I use?</h4>
<p>These applications have been designed for smartphones that satisfy the following criteria:</p>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>Large screen (ideally with a resolution of 480x320 or greater)</li>
<li>Touch sensitive</li>
<li>Fully-featured browser.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following mobile devices are supported:</p>
<ul class="checklist">
<li>iPhone 4 or later</li>
<li>iPad</li>
<li>Phones running Android 4.1 or later</li>
</ul>
<p>The applications may work with other mobile devices, but this usage will be unsupported.</p>

<h4>Why do I sometimes need to re-login?</h4>
<p>For security reasons, the application will automatically log users out if left idle for a period of four hours. Provided that you access the application within this period you will not be required to log back in.</p>

<h4>What happens if my phone loses its signal while submitting a bet?</h4>
<p>If your phone loses it signal after you have pressed the final "Place Bet" and before you receive a bet confirmation with a ticket number, RWWA cannot guarantee that your bet was successfully placed.</p>
<p>We recommend you check the transaction page within "My Account". If the transaction is not listed then please contact our Customer Management Team on <a href="tel:1300363688">1300 36 36 88</a> to confirm the bet status.</p>

<h4>How can I protect my account if my phone is lost or stolen?</h4>
<p>In addition to normal precautions, the following steps should be taken to protect your account in the event of a lost or stolen phone:</p>
<ul class="compact">
<li>Always log out of TABtouch when you have finished betting.</li>
<li>If you are betting over an extended period of time and wish to remain logged in, you should activate your phone's lock code to prevent unauthorised access.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Why do I lose my selections when I press the browser refresh button?</h4>
<p>The browser refresh button will cause a complete reload of the current page. Any user-entered data (e.g., bet selections) will be cleared.</p>
<p>TABtouch has a refresh button in the upper right corner. Pressing this button will allow you to obtain updated dividends and pool sizes while maintaining your selections.</p>

<h4>Why does my browser back button not work?</h4>
<p>Support for the browser back button relies on functionality that is not available in all browsers.</p>
<p>TABtouch provides a button in the top left corner that will allow you to return to the parent page of the current page. You can also navigate back to the landing page by clicking on the 'Home' icon or application icon.</p>
<p>Note that the browser back button should not be used during betting operations, as it will not retain user-entered data.</p>

<h4>Do I need to have cookies enabled?</h4>
<p>Yes, TABtouch  uses cookies so you will need to have them enabled for the applications to function correctly. If you don't enable them you will receive an error message when you attempt to log on.</p>

<h4>The deposit function does not let me enter a credit card.</h4>
<p>You can only deposit money into your account if you have pre-registered your credit card details with RWWA. If you want to deposit money or pre-register your credit card, please contact the Customer Management Team on <a href="tel:1300363688">1300 36 36 88</a>.</p>

<h4>My question isn't answered here, where can I get help?</h4>
<p>Our Customer Management Team will be happy to help with your query. They can be contacted on <a href="tel:1300363688">1300 36 36 88</a> or, alternatively, email <a href="mailto:ContactUs@tabtouch.com.au">ContactUs@tabtouch.com.au</a>.</p>

<h3 id="restricted">Restricted Country FAQ</h3>

<h4>Why am I receiving a restricted country error message if I'm located in Australia?</h4>
<p>TABtouch uses information tied to your internet connection to determine the country in which you are located. This message indicates that you were present in a restricted country. This may be due to the use of anonymising tools or services such as Anonymising Proxies, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Tor, Satellite Providers and Hosting Providers.</p>

<h4>What are anonymising tools or services?</h4>
<p>Anonymising tools or services hide your location or prevent your location from being determined. They include Anonymising Proxies, Virtual Private Networks (VPN), Tor, Satellite Providers and Hosting Providers. These services can be often be running on your phone or desktop computer without you realizing.</p>

<h4>How do I know if my connection is using anonymising technology?</h4>
<p>There are ways for determining if you’re using an anonymising tool or service. The approach to doing so varies according to the device you are using to access the internet. You may need to seek expert help to do so. For more assistance, call our customer service team.</p>

    <!-- Cash Betting -->

    <h3 id="cashbetting1">Cash Betting</h3>
    
    <p>No account? No worries, on TABtouch you can pay with cash. TABtouch offers multiple payment methods so you can create your bets on your mobile and then either pay from anywhere using your TABtouch account or by using cash at any TAB outlet.</p>
    <p>To use cash as your payment option first turn on Cash Betting in the My Bets menu. Then build your bet as normal, once you&rsquo;ve entered your stake you have 2 payment options  &ndash;  Account or Cash. Choose the &lsquo;Cash&rsquo; option and your bet will display as a barcode, which you can scan to place your bet at any TAB counter, Self Service or WA racecourse. To complete bet placement pay the TAB operator or insert your cash into the TAB Self Service. You will then receive your printed bet ticket as your receipt. If you are not ready to scan your bet straight away it will be saved for later, you can access all of your saved cash bets under the My Bets menu.</p>

    <h4>Cash Betting FAQ</h4>
    
    <h5>Do I need to turn on cash betting every time I want to bet?</h5>
    <p>No, you only need to turn on cash betting once. It will then remain on as an option every time you use TABtouch or manually switch it off.</p>

    <h5>How many single bets can I place in one transaction?</h5>
    <p>Up to 10 single bets can be added to the Bet Slip to be placed in one transaction.</p>

    <h5>How many cash bets can I save?</h5>
    <p>Up to 100 cash bets can be saved to your device and any one time.</p>

    <h5>Can I scan a barcode more than once?</h5>
    <p>Yes, a barcode can be scanned multiple times to place the same bet more than once.</p>

    <h5>I have received my barcode, does this mean my bet has been placed?</h5>
    <p>The barcode is not a placed bet. In order for the bet to be placed, the barcode must be scanned and paid for at a TAB facility. You will then receive a printed bet receipt.</p>

    <h5>Will my barcode be automatically deleted once the bet has been placed?</h5>
    <p>No, your barcodes do not automatically delete from your device once scanned and bets placed.</p>
    
    <p>Please be aware that if you do not delete your barcode once you have scanned it and betting is still open on those events, you might inadvertently rescan the same bet again, thereby producing another ticket requiring payment.</p>
